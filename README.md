This project consists of two scripts where one will factor out a polynomial and the other will distribute it. 

For the Factoring script, ensure you are putting it in a format with brackets []. With the bracket in place, the numbers can either be separated with a comma, whitespace, both or new line.

For the distributing script, the formatting is picky, ensure you are explicitly writing a '*' for each multiplication, other wise it will give a syntax error.
